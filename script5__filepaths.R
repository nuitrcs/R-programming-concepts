# Here is the basic code to read in (import) a CSV file and save it to a variable called "x":
x <- read.csv("test.csv")  # this won't work if you run it, since there's no test.csv file!

# QUEST!!
# Read in the file nu_all_fac.csv from the data folder (fill in the file path below)
# Remember to surround the file name with ""
x <- read.csv(   )
